My page contains a drumkit macropad. All drum sounds are created by Loke Vikne. <br>
The drumroll randomizer button creates a drumroll that ranges from 5 to 20 beats, and will vary in length. <br>
I've tried to style it to look like one of the colorful macropads often used during DJ sets, music production etc. <br><br>

Hope you enjoy!
